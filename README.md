# umpisa-reservation
Project for umpisa application

##
Notes
Downloaded the initial template from https://start.spring.io/ where we could add Java version, build tool, and dependencies
Once the Springboot template is done, I create a ReservationData model based on the requirements. After the model, I created a service called ReservationService
To test the logic for the service I used a unit test called ReservationServiceTest. 
Now for the controller, I've named it ReservationController and to test the API endpoints I've used Postman for API testing
